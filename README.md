You are given a 2D matrix of dimension mxn and a positive integer . You have to rotate the matrix  times and print the resultant matrix. Rotation should be in anti-clockwise direction.

Function Description

Complete the matrixRotation function in the editor below. It should print the resultant 2D integer array and return nothing.

matrixRotation has the following parameter(s):

matrix: a 2D array of integers
r: an integer that represents the rotation factor

Input Format

The first line contains three space separated integers m, n and r the number of rows and columns in matrix and the required rotation.
The next m lines contain n space-separated integers representing the elements of a row of matrix.
